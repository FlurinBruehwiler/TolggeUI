# Flamui
A C# immediate mode desktop GUI framework.

**This Project is in very early development, not usable in any way!**

Immediate mode means that you don't have to worry about state, the entire UI gets rebuilt every frame.

The framework uses a custom OpenGl Renderer and GLFW to manage Windows, Input, Graphics Context, etc. via [Silk.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) Bindings.
